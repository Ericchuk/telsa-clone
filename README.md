So i decided to clone telsa as i have done before but not on this repository.
It was difficult getting the font-family, still haven't gotten it.
Color and background color were also difficult to find to i just pick colors that are closer but no it.
Tomorrow i will be trying the animation aspect of the webpage, slidefromcenter, and see how well it will respond then create the menu section and move to javascript for interactivity of the page.
